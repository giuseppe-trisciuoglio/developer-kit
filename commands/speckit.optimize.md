## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

**Goal**: Analyze tasks.md to optimize the implementation workflow by identifying parallelization opportunities, task dependencies, resource requirements, and generating an optimized execution plan with subagent delegation strategy. This command prepares tasks.md for efficient execution via `/speckit.implement`.

**When to run**: After `/speckit.check-integration` completes, BEFORE `/speckit.implement` executes tasks.

**Critical Principle**: This command NEVER modifies tasks.md or code files. It only analyzes and reports optimization recommendations. Output is a READ-ONLY optimization report.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Setup & Prerequisites

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse JSON for:
- FEATURE_DIR (absolute path)
- TASKS file path
- AVAILABLE_DOCS list

For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

Abort if tasks.md is missing with error: "No tasks.md found. Run `/speckit.tasks` first."

### 2. Load Optimization Context

**Required files**:
- tasks.md: Complete task list with phases, IDs, descriptions, and parallelization markers [P]
- plan.md: Tech stack, architecture, team structure
- spec.md: Feature requirements and complexity assessment

**Optional files** (load if present):
- data-model.md: Data dependencies between tasks
- contracts/: API contract dependencies
- research.md: Technical constraints and decisions

**Codebase scan**:
- Identify project structure and complexity
- Map existing test patterns (unit, integration, e2e)
- Assess resource requirements (memory, CPU, external services)
- List available subagent types from available configuration

### 3. Parse Tasks Structure

Extract task information:

```
For each task in tasks.md:
- Task ID: Extract [ID] (e.g., T001, T126)
- Parallelization marker: Extract [P] if present
- Phase: Which phase/group task belongs to
- Description: Full task description
- Dependencies: Infer from description or explicit phase ordering
- Complexity: Assess as LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL based on:
  * Lines of code expected
  * Test coverage required
  * External dependencies (databases, APIs)
  * Integration points
```

### 4. Dependency Analysis

**Build dependency graph**:

```
Task → Task Dependencies Analysis:

CRITICAL (blocking):
- Phase 1 → Phase 2 (Phase 2 blocked until Phase 1 complete)
- Phase 2 → Phase 3+ (Phase 3+ blocked until Phase 2 complete)
- Within-phase: Tasks without [P] marker may have implicit dependencies

IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES:
- T002 (pom.xml) → T018 (configuration properties)
- Configuration tasks → Infrastructure implementation
- Domain models → Repository implementations
- Service implementations → Test infrastructure
```

**Output**:
```
DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS

Blocking Dependencies (Sequential):
- Phase 1 → Phase 2: [BLOCKING] Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2 starts
- Phase 2 → User Stories: [BLOCKING] Foundational layer required for all user story work

Critical Internal Dependencies:
- [Task A] → [Task B]: [Reason] (Must complete A before starting B)
- [Task X] → [Task Y/Z]: [Reason] (Task X blocks multiple dependents)

Independent Task Groups (Can parallelize):
- Group [N]: Tasks [ID, ID, ID] - All marked [P], no internal dependencies
  * Estimated parallel execution time: [minutes]
  * Resource requirement: [CPU/Memory profile]
```

### 5. Parallelization Opportunities

**Identify parallelizable task groups**:

```
PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY

Within-Phase Parallelization:
- [P] marked tasks: Can run simultaneously (different files, no dependencies)
- Grouped by agent type for efficient team allocation

Potential Parallelization:
- Tasks that could be parallelized with refactoring
- Risks: List any hidden dependencies or integration points
- Recommendation: Whether to parallelize or keep sequential

Sequential Requirements:
- Tasks that MUST run serially (blocking relationships)
- Reasons: Dependency chains, shared state, integration points
```

### 6. Subagent Assignment Strategy

**Analyze workload distribution**:

```
SUBAGENT DELEGATION ANALYSIS

Task Distribution by Complexity:
- CRITICAL tasks: [Count] (needs expert/experienced subagent)
- HIGH tasks: [Count] (needs intermediate subagent)
- MEDIUM tasks: [Count] (can distribute across team)
- LOW tasks: [Count] (can batch or auto-run)

Required Subagent Types:
- spring-boot-backend-development-expert: [Task IDs] - [Time estimate]
- spring-boot-test-expert: [Task IDs] - [Time estimate]
- [Other specialists]: [Task IDs] - [Time estimate]

Resource Constraints:
- Concurrent subagents available: [N]
- Time per subagent batch: [minutes]
- Memory per subagent: [MB estimate]
```

### 7. Execution Phases & Timeline

**Generate optimized execution plan**:

```
OPTIMIZED EXECUTION PLAN

- With optimal parallelization: [Y] minutes (Z% reduction)
- Wall-clock time (assuming N concurrent subagents): [W] minutes
```

### 8. Resource Estimation

**Calculate resource requirements**:

```
RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

Memory Usage Profile:
- Setup Phase: [MB]
- Per parallel subagent: [MB]
- Testing infrastructure: [MB]
- Total peak: [MB]

CPU Requirements:
- Compilation tasks: MEDIUM (can share)
- Test execution: HIGH (parallel benefit significant)
- Code generation: MEDIUM

External Dependencies:
- Docker/Testcontainers: [Yes/No] → Startup time [minutes]
- Database services: [Services listed] → Availability window [minutes]
- API mock servers: [Services listed] → Setup time [minutes]

Network Bandwidth:
- Dependency download: [MB]
- Docker image pulls: [MB]
- Artifact uploads: [MB]
```

### 9. Risk Assessment

**Identify optimization risks**:

```
RISK ASSESSMENT

High-Risk Dependencies:
- [Risk]: Task A depends on Task B completing and compiling
  * Mitigation: Run immediate validation after B completes
  * Impact if fails: Cascading failure to all dependent tasks

Integration Points:
- [Point]: Configuration tasks must synchronize state
  * Mitigation: Validate configuration after each phase batch
  * Impact if fails: Runtime errors in downstream phases

Parallelization Risks:
- [Risk]: Tasks T002 and T003 both modify configuration
  * Mitigation: Enforce sequential ordering (already done with [P] marker)
  * Impact if fails: Configuration conflicts, merge issues
```

### 10. Optimization Recommendations

**Generate specific recommendations**:

```
OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

Priority 1: Critical Path Optimization
1. **Parallelize Setup Phase Batches**
   - Current: [X] minutes (assuming sequential)
   - Optimized: [Y] minutes (batches: B1.1 → B1.2)
   - Savings: [Z]% with [N] concurrent subagents
   - Implementation: Assign T002/T003/T126 to Batch 1.2 (after T001)

2. **Pre-compile Dependency Resolution**
   - Recommendation: Run `mvn dependency:resolve` once
   - Benefit: Avoid repeated downloads in parallel builds
   - Timing: Before starting any compilation tasks

Priority 2: Subagent Utilization
1. **Dedicate Specialists by Phase**
   - Phase 1.1: 1x backend-expert (T001), 1x test-expert (T004)
   - Phase 1.2: 1x backend-expert (T002-T159 cohort)
   - Benefit: Specialized focus, reduced context-switching

2. **Batch Similar Tasks**
   - Group T126/T127/T128: Configuration & threading (coherent scope)
   - Group T156/T157/T158/T159: Batch optimization (coherent scope)
   - Benefit: Reduced cognitive load, better error handling

Priority 3: Checkpoint Strategy
1. **Insert Compilation Checkpoints**
   - After T001: Run `mvn clean compile` (validate structure)
   - After T002/T003: Run `mvn clean compile` (validate config)
   - After T004: Run `mvn test-compile` (validate test setup)
   - Benefit: Catch errors early before downstream tasks start

2. **Test Validation Sequence**
   - Phase 1 complete → Run `mvn test` immediately
   - Blocks: All user story work until Phase 1 tests pass
   - Benefit: Prevent cascading test failures

Priority 4: Error Recovery
1. **Graceful Failure Handling**
   - If Phase 1.1 fails: Halt all Phase 1.2+ tasks
   - If Phase 1 compilation fails: Stop parallel execution, investigate sequentially
   - Recovery: Re-run failed task batch after fix

2. **Subagent Reassignment**
   - If subagent crashes: Reassign task to backup subagent
   - Track completion: Mark task [X] only after validation passes
   - Retry policy: 2 attempts per task before manual escalation
```
