## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

**Goal**: Analyze tasks.md to verify each task considers existing codebase implementations, integration opportunities, and architectural compatibility. This is a READ-ONLY analysis command that reports findings without modifying any files.

**When to run**: After `/speckit.tasks` generates tasks.md but BEFORE `/speckit.implement` executes them.

**Critical Principle**: This command NEVER modifies code, tasks, or any files. It only analyzes and reports.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Setup & Prerequisites

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse JSON for:
- FEATURE_DIR (absolute path)
- TASKS file path
- AVAILABLE_DOCS list

For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

Abort if tasks.md is missing with error: "No tasks.md found. Run `/speckit.tasks` first."

### 2. Load Context

**Required files**:
- tasks.md: Complete task list with file paths and descriptions
- plan.md: Tech stack, architecture, dependencies
- spec.md: Feature requirements and scope

**Optional files** (load if present):
- data-model.md: Entity definitions
- contracts/: API specifications
- research.md: Technical decisions

**Codebase scan**:
- Identify project root structure (src/, lib/, components/, etc.)
- List existing dependencies from package.json/requirements.txt/etc.
- Map existing modules, services, utilities, components
- Identify configuration files (database, API, environment)

### 3. Build Codebase Inventory

Create internal mapping of existing implementations:

**Infrastructure & Configuration**:
- Database setup, migrations, ORM configurations
- API framework initialization (Express, FastAPI, etc.)
- Authentication/authorization systems
- Logging, monitoring, error handling utilities
- Environment configuration patterns

**Data Layer**:
- Existing models/entities with fields and relationships
- Database access patterns (repositories, DAOs)
- Data validation utilities
- Schema management approaches

**Service Layer**:
- Business logic services
- Integration services (external APIs, third-party)
- Utility services (email, notifications, file handling)
- Caching mechanisms

**API Layer**:
- Existing endpoints and route patterns
- Request/response handlers
- Middleware (auth, validation, error handling)
- API versioning approach

**UI Components** (if applicable):
- Component library and design system
- Layout components
- Shared utilities (hooks, contexts)
- State management patterns

**Testing Infrastructure**:
- Test frameworks and utilities
- Mock/fixture patterns
- Test database setup
- CI/CD test integration

### 4. Analyze Each Task

For every task in tasks.md, perform this structured analysis:

#### A. Existing Implementation Detection

**Scan for**:
- Similar functionality already implemented
- Overlapping components/modules
- Duplicate data models or entities
- Redundant API endpoints
- Existing utilities that solve the same problem

**Output for each finding**:
```
EXISTING: [File path]
Lines: [Line range]
Description: [What it does]
Similarity: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
Reason: [Why it's relevant to this task]
```

#### B. Integration Opportunity Analysis

**Check if task can**:
- Extend existing components rather than create new ones
- Reuse existing utilities/helpers
- Integrate with established patterns
- Leverage installed dependencies
- Follow existing architectural patterns

**Output for each opportunity**:
```
INTEGRATION: [Approach]
With: [Existing component/pattern]
Benefit: [Why integration is better than from-scratch]
Risk: [Potential conflicts or limitations]
```

#### C. Dependency & Library Check

**Verify**:
- Required libraries already installed
- Similar functionality in existing dependencies
- Configuration already present
- Patterns already established in codebase

**Output**:
```
DEPENDENCY: [Package/library name]
Status: [INSTALLED/NOT_INSTALLED]
Usage: [Where used in codebase]
Alternative: [If similar functionality exists]
```

#### D. Architectural Compatibility

**Assess**:
- Task aligns with existing architecture
- File structure matches project conventions
- Naming conventions consistency
- Design patterns compatibility

**Output**:
```
COMPATIBILITY: [ALIGNED/PARTIAL/MISALIGNED]
Architecture: [Current pattern in codebase]
Task Approach: [What task proposes]
Concern: [If any conflicts detected]
```

### 5. Task-Level Evaluation

For each task, answer these questions:

**Integration Assessment**:
- [ ] CONSIDERS - Task explicitly mentions existing code to integrate with
- [ ] PARTIAL - Task could integrate but doesn't mention existing code
- [ ] IGNORES - Task proposes from-scratch solution when integration possible
- [ ] NEW - Task is genuinely new, no existing code applies

**Codebase Awareness**:
- [ ] AWARE - Task references existing patterns/utilities/components
- [ ] UNAWARE - Task doesn't consider relevant existing implementations

**Duplication Risk**:
- [ ] NONE - No overlap with existing code
- [ ] LOW - Minor overlap, integration not critical
- [ ] MEDIUM - Significant overlap, integration recommended
- [ ] HIGH - Major overlap, integration mandatory
- [ ] CRITICAL - Duplicates existing functionality, task should be rewritten

### 6. Generate Analysis Report

Output a structured Markdown report (DO NOT write to file, display only):

## Task Integration Analysis Report

**Feature**: [Feature name from tasks.md]
**Analysis Date**: [Current date]
**Tasks Analyzed**: [Total count]

### Integration Checklist

Use this to verify tasks have been updated appropriately:

- [ ] All CRITICAL duplication risks addressed
- [ ] HIGH-risk integration opportunities incorporated
- [ ] Existing utilities/patterns referenced in relevant tasks
- [ ] New dependencies justified (no existing alternatives)
- [ ] Architectural patterns acknowledged
- [ ] File paths align with existing structure
- [ ] Naming conventions consistent with codebase

---

### Next Steps

**If CRITICAL issues found**:
1. Review and update tasks.md manually based on recommendations
2. Re-run `/speckit.check-integration` to verify fixes
3. Proceed to `/speckit.implement` when clear

**If MEDIUM issues found**:
- You may proceed to `/speckit.implement` but review recommendations
- Consider integration opportunities during implementation
- Flag for post-implementation refactoring if needed

**If LOW/NONE issues**:
- ✅ Tasks are integration-aware
- ✅ Safe to proceed with `/speckit.implement`

---

## Analysis Principles

### What This Command Does

✅ **DOES**:
- Read codebase to find existing implementations
- Identify integration opportunities
- Detect potential duplication
- Check dependency status
- Verify architectural alignment
- Report findings with specific file/line references
- Provide concrete recommendations

❌ **DOES NOT**:
- Modify any files (strictly read-only)
- Rewrite tasks automatically
- Change codebase
- Execute tasks
- Make assumptions without evidence
- Hallucinate implementations

### Analysis Quality Standards

**Evidence-Based**:
- Every finding MUST cite specific files/lines
- No speculation about "probably exists"
- If uncertain, mark as "Needs Manual Verification"

**Actionable**:
- Each recommendation includes specific next steps
- Reference exact files/components to integrate with
- Provide integration approach suggestions

**Risk-Calibrated**:
- CRITICAL: Blocks implementation, must fix
- HIGH: Strongly recommend addressing
- MEDIUM: Consider during implementation
- LOW: Optional improvement

**Context-Aware**:
- Consider project size and maturity
- Respect existing architectural decisions
- Balance purity vs pragmatism
- Account for technical debt tradeoffs

### Efficiency Guidelines

**Progressive Scanning**:
- Load files on-demand (don't dump everything)
- Focus on high-signal areas first
- Skip obviously unrelated code

**Token Management**:
- Summarize large files (don't quote entire contents)
- Reference by path + line range, not full code blocks
- Group similar findings

**Report Sizing**:
- Limit to 50 most important findings
- Summarize remainder in overflow section
- Prioritize by risk level

## Validation

Before outputting report, verify:

- [ ] Every finding cites specific file/line evidence
- [ ] Risk levels assigned consistently
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and actionable
- [ ] No modifications made to any files
- [ ] Report is concise yet complete (token-efficient)
- [ ] Integration opportunities clearly explained
- [ ] Duplication risks quantified with specifics
- [ ] Dependencies checked against actual project files
