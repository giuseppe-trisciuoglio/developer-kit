### Creating a Skill - Step by Step

1. **Create the directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p skills/[category]/[skill-name]
   ```

2. **Create SKILL.md** with required frontmatter:
   - `name`: lowercase, hyphens (no spaces)
   - `description`: Specific, includes trigger keywords, states both what AND when

3. **Add supporting files** as needed:
   - `reference.md`: Technical specifications, APIs, configurations
   - `examples.md`: Practical, runnable examples progressing from basic to advanced
   - `scripts/`: Helper utilities (Python, Bash, JavaScript)

4. **Follow content guidelines**:
   - Target audience: Developers using Claude Code for that domain
   - Include both Maven and Gradle configs for Java/Spring Boot skills
   - Code samples follow best practices from the domain
   - Examples should be copy-paste ready
   - Performance guidelines where applicable

5. **Test your skill**:
   - Ask Claude questions matching your description
   - Verify Claude discovers and uses the skill appropriately
   - Test with various use cases and edge cases

### Skill Content Guidelines

**Structure**:
- Keep SKILL.md focused on instructions (~200-400 lines)
- Use supporting files for extensive reference material
- Progressive disclosure: advanced topics in separate files
- Clear section hierarchy (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)

**Examples**:
- Show progression: simple ‚Üí complex
- Include actual outputs/results
- Provide context for each example
- Use realistic data and scenarios
- For framework skills: include both Maven and Gradle

**Best Practices**:
- Language-specific conventions (Java vs Python vs TypeScript)
- Security considerations for the domain
- Performance guidelines and benchmarks
- SOLID principles where applicable
- Common anti-patterns to avoid
- Integration points with other tools/skills

**Documentation**:
- Assume reader has basic domain knowledge
- Define specialized terminology
- Link to related skills
- Include references to official documentation
- Credit sources and inspiration

## ü§ñ Creating a New Agent

### Directory Structure
```
agents/[agent-name].md
```

### Agent File Format

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Natural language description of when this agent should be used. Include specific use cases and trigger keywords.
tools: Read, Bash, Edit      # Optional: comma-separated. Omit to inherit all tools.
model: sonnet                 # Optional: sonnet, opus, haiku, or inherit
---

# Agent Name

You are a [specific role] expert. Your responsibilities include:
- Specific capability 1
- Specific capability 2
- Specific capability 3

## When to Use
- Clear trigger conditions
- Use cases and scenarios
- What problems it solves
- When NOT to use this agent

## Process
1. First step: Initial analysis or gathering information
2. Analysis: Investigation and understanding
3. Implementation: Action and solution
4. Verification: Testing and confirmation

## Guidelines
- Best practices for this domain
- Constraints and limitations
- Error handling and edge cases
- When to escalate back to main thread
- Performance considerations

## Example Workflow
Provide a concrete example showing typical usage
```

### Agent Guidelines

- **Specific description** with trigger keywords (not generic)
- **Single responsibility** focused on one domain
- **Tool restrictions** for security and focus (omit tools: field to inherit all)
- **Detailed process** with clear workflow steps
- **Include "proactively"** in description if agent should auto-detect usage
- **Comprehensive guidelines** covering edge cases

## ‚ö° Creating a Slash Command

### File Structure
```
commands/[category/]command-name.md
```

### Command Format

```markdown
---
description: Brief command description for /help

argument-hint: [arg1] [arg2] [arg3]
---

## Command Description

Clear explanation of what the command does.

Use $1, $2, $3 for positional arguments.
Use $ARGUMENTS for all arguments combined.
